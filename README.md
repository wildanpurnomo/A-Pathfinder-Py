A* algorithm is the efficient pathfinding method and I wanted to make the visualization of its process. This was not done yet actually, so what you see here is just messy messy codes. But at this point, I'm able to connect two nodes using A*. 

So, when you compile the code, program will display grid. The grid is our maze. If you press CTRL + left click, it will create start point in red color. If you press CTRL + right click, it will create end point in green color. If you drag with hold right click, it will create wall or obstacle in black color. Once you've done with the setup, press Enter key to make the program search path between red and green node. If the search process is success, path will be created after in blue color. 

Dimension of grid and window are hard coded, so you may just change it.
